## Install

Topic [Установка (Installation)](https://forkbb.ru/topic/28/ustanovka-installation)

### For Apache:

Apache must have **mod_rewrite** and **mod_headers** enabled. Also, the **AllowOverride** directive must be set to **All**.

Two options
1. Shared hosting or site folder (Document Root != [**/public/**](https://github.com/forkbb/forkbb/tree/master/public) folder):
    * Rename **.dist.htaccess** to **.htaccess**,
    * Rename **index.dist.php** to **index.php**.
    * (If you install the forum engine in the site folder, there may be conflicts between the forum's .htaccess rules and the site's .htaccess rules.)
2. VPS/VDS with access to Apache configuration (Document Root == [**/public/**](https://github.com/forkbb/forkbb/tree/master/public) folder):
    * Rename /public/**.dist.htaccess** to /public/**.htaccess**,
    * Rename /public/**index.dist.php** to /public/**index.php**;

### For NGINX:

* [Example](https://github.com/forkbb/forkbb/blob/master/nginx.dist.conf) nginx configuration.
* Note: Root must point to the [**/public/**](https://github.com/forkbb/forkbb/tree/master/public) directory.
* Note: The **index.dist.php** file does not need to be renamed.

## Favicon
* You can rename /public/**favicon48.ico** file to /public/**favicon.ico**
* You can create your own favicon file and copy it to /public/favicon.ico
